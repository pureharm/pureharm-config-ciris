# Contributing

For now we're winging it with issues and feature requests. Start up a discussion and we'll take it from there!

## building project locally

Java 8+, recommended to install via [`sdkman`](https://sdkman.io/) which can then also install sbt for you.

## the future

Hopefully we'll provide a nice [nix shell](https://nixos.org), especially when we add the website.
